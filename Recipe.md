First, lets make the ingredients ready. Cut the tomato and the cucumber into thin slices and keep them aside for later use.

Then, take 2 loaves of bread and apply the sauce or pizza spread on one side of both the loaves using a spoon.

Next, place the tomato slices on one of the slices, and then cucumber on top.

Then if you love origano and cheese, sprinkle origano on the cucumber slices and place a cheese slice on top.
*You can also use chilli flakes instead of origano, or both!

Finally, place the other slice of bread on top and your mouth-watering sandwich is ready.
